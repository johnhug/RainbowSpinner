# RainbowSpinner

Arduino IDE Project

Spins a rainbow on a RGB LED ring and randomly picks a color to stick with until turned off.

Somewhat inspired by Howl's Moving Castle door selection.


## Hardware

Found a fun little two pack of closet lights at the home store.
The three AA power and click on/off switch made for a decent enclosure.
Removed the LED board and swapped it with an ATTiny85 with a 16 LED WS8212B Ring.
Added a 10k pot as a speed tuning input.
All circuit power is post switch, so the program sleeps at the end for the user to turn off.
